Hello there!

I am a second master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech specializing in Computer Systems and Software. 

I love coding, Linux and games. I spent this summer at Amazon (Seattle) working as a software development engineer intern. My role is to create a web online previewer using Django, C++ Rendering framework, JQuery and Bootstrap.
